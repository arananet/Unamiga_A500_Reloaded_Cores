There are two folders here, one is for the 1.4 version with the multicore header that has 512k of SRAM.

The other folder is for the 1.5 version that includes 1MB of SRAM.

In both cases you must need a SDcard to hold all the NEXT core files. The required files can be download from the original NEXT repository https://www.specnext.com/latestdistro/. In order to start using the core you will need to setup the screen resolution which will be available at the boot of the core. Once you finish setting up the screen configuration you will boot into the TBCORE and then the NEXT core will start.
