# Unamiga A500 Header and Unamiga Reloaded Cores.

This repository contains all the cores available for the Unamiga A500 Header and Unamiga Reloaded boards. All of them are in RBF format so they can be used with the multicore support available on the next boards:

### Unamiga A500 1.4 (with multicore hat)
### Unamiga A500 1.5
### Unamiga Reloaded

Browse the CORES directory to download the required one.

##Note: Usually each core requires to have the SD card for the FPGA with his own filesystem, for example the MSX and the SPECCY (next) cores. The MINIMIG (AMIGA) core could coexist witht eh C64.

# Special thanks

Thanks to @benitoss for the amazing job of porting all the cores to my boards.
Thanks to Victor Trucco for create the multicore system.
Thanks to the Unamiga users that has been a huge support to keep this project alive.
